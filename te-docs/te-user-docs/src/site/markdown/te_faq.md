#FAQ

## What TAF version is supported by TE?
Any. But using old TAF without Allure support will mean you'll have no reports.

## Haven't found your question here?

You can find plenty of FAQ about TAF Test Executor on [TAF stackoverflow](https://taf-stackoverflow.seli.wh.rnd.internal.ericsson.com/index.php?qa=tag&qa_1=taf-te).
If you cannot find your question there, feel free to post it, but please make sure you use the tag "taf-te"
(for questions about [TE vApp](te_vapp.html)) or "taf-trigger" (for questions about [TE Trigger plugin](te_trigger_plugin.html)).
