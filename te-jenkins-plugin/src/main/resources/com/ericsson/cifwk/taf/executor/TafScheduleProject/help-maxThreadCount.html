<p>Max thread count that testware JVM is allowed to spawn.</p>
<p>If JVM will hit this limit, a thread dump will be printed.</p>
<p>Use this option to investigate thread leaks in the testware. If defined, this value will be propagated to all executor jobs,
    so they can be retriggered with updated value if needed. Make sure the default value here is big enough,
    in order not to become a bottleneck.</p>
