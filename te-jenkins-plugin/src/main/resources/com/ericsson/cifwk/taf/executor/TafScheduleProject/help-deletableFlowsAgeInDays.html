    Define a non-zero value to define how many days to keep old TE data:
    <ul>
    <li>
    <b><a target="_blank" href="https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Build+Flow+Plugin">Build Flow</a> projects</b>,
        each of which gets created when a new TE job is scheduled. Such project has only one build, and this is the
        limitation of the Build Flow plugin. So if the tests run often, Jenkins workspace gets quickly filled up with
        the Build Flow projects. The current setting will define the max lifetime of build flow projects, after that
        time they will get erased.</li>
        <li><b>Test run data</b>. When each schedule item is executed, it's forking a Maven process for appropriate tests execution.
        To limit the amount of disk space used, the current setting will define, how many days those temporary directories
            (seen in TAF_EXECUTOR project's workspace) shall remain</li>
    </ul>
